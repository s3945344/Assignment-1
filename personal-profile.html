	<h2>My results</h2>
	<h3>MBTI: <br>
    ISFP-T</h3> <img src="isfp.png" alt="mbti result">
	<p id="rcorners1">This is the most common form of test in terms of personality and it is highly popular with many people. The result I got is ISFP-T, classified as the “Adventurer” on 16Personalities. Based on these results, I am more of an introvert, observant, I follow my feelings more than my thinking, I am more prospecting rather than judging, and I am turbulent. Introverts have been known to gain energy from being alone and prefer to be in a more quiet environment to recharge. Observant (or Sensing) behaviour refers to gathering facts from relying on their senses such as sight, touch and hearing, they gather these facts from their immediate environment and surroundings. The results have also presented me as a feeler, which focuses on how I choose to follow my emotions when making decisions. Lastly, I am considered a perceiver which is more focused on the organisational aspect in the environment. In my case, I am someone who prefers to be more flexible and not as organised in terms of keeping a tight schedule or list of things I have to do.

	<h3>Honey and Mumford Learning Styles: <br>
    Reflector</h3> <img src="learning styles.png" alt="learning styles result">
	<p id="rcorners1">The ‘Reflector’ learning style is the people who prefer to observe the situation by standing back and seeing, rather than to jump into anything. They also like to see from different perspectives, collecting data from both first-hand and others. They prefer to think about what is happening and also take in what they are observing, to then use it to come to an appropriate conclusion. It is also highlighted that reflectors are cautious and they feel the need to consider all possible sides before committing to doing something. It is believed that reflectors learn best when they have time to think before taking action and also giving them time to investigate the situation. They are quite passive learners and they prefer to work together as a team player than to take lead as a team leader.

	<h3>Leadership Style <br>
    Front-Line</h3> <img src="leadership style.png" alt="leadership style result">
	<p id="rcorners1">This Leadership Style test was run by the University of Southern California: Executive Master of Leadership to present six different leadership styles that one could possess. These types of leadership styles are used and analysed to enhance a person's professional career - by establishing what kind of leader they are, it can also help them find ways to find strategies to make them a better leader, depending on their style. The front-line leaders are people who are hands-on and highly engaged with their team members, focusing heavily on knowing how to connect with them. It is also highlighted that front-line leaders aim to empower those around them, with the goal of helping them to achieve their best. These types of leaders are also known to display empathy and demonstrate authenticity for their team members. By being able to be authentic, they open and share themselves to others which can help with engaging team members to share the same vision the leader has.

		<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
		<p id="rcorners1">I have always had an interest in tests that give a written description of what kind of person you are based on the answers you choose. It allows me to learn about myself and how a test perceives me, as well as categorising me in a specific category. I feel that it is very beneficial in defining key features about myself and it can present my traits to others, allowing them to have an idea of what kind of person I am. However, I only view these results in an entertaining and fun way, therefore, only taking the results with a grain of salt. I believe that these results shouldn’t define a person just because it is in the form of a test or quiz. At the end of the day, this is a calculated and defined method of establishing the type of person someone is based on the results they choose, and it is also possible someone could easily manipulate the test or quiz to the result they want. </p>

		<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
		<p id="rcorners1">It can definitely bring an insight to the type of people who are in a team, as well as find out what kind of styles or personalities they have. It can definitely cause people to see how they think or respond to a situation, for example, the MBTI test can present those who are more emotionally driven as well as those who are more logical and calculated with their decisions. It can also allow for team members to understand how they could work together and it can highlight the strengths and weaknesses of their team members. By setting a clear profile of their strengths and weaknesses, team members can learn how to enhance each other's strengths, and improve each other’s weaknesses when performing tasks. If a team knows how to work cooperatively despite their differences, it can improve their efficiency as everyone will be working on a task that they are strongest with completing.</p>

	<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
	<p id="rcorners1">These test results can be taken into account as it highlights each person’s strengths and how they would respond to a particular situation they come across. It also allows for more diversity in terms of people’s personality and work style. Therefore, when forming a team, it is good to have a wide range of different types of people as it opens up for more ideas and innovation, as team members will bounce ideas off each other’s suggestions. However, it is also very important to consider how people may clash due to different interests or different styles in regards to how they approach the given task. Therefore, it is important to form teams with people who are able to work well together. </p>
