    <h3>What is your ideal job?</h3>
      <p id="rcorners1"><a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/work-with-us/job/3347738/game-producer-ii-ui-ux-valorant-los-angeles-usa">This position</a>, which is provided by Riot Games, is focused on the vision of their product, a first person shooter game, ‘Valorant’. Riot Games expects the Game Producer II to be responsible for assisting in ensuring that Riot delivers content and features of high quality and satisfaction for their consumers. Other tasks the Game Producer II will have include being able to track progress with the gaming experience of their players kept in mind, focusing on organising priorities and goals, as well as delivering upcoming features and content. The Game Producer II is also required to work together with other positions in the company such as artists, engineers, and designers in order to present a quality product and experience for Riot’s players. <br>
           <br>
      As a Riot Games consumer, particularly with their game, ‘Valorant’, I have always considered potentially working at Riot Games. What I find so appealing about this position is how heavily involved the Game Producer II is in the production of the game and the future developments that are yet to come. I find that it would be very rewarding to be working on the newest updates and seeing it in the game itself. Another aspect that I like about this position is the opportunity to work with artists and designers, which is something I have always wanted to do as I love seeing how a design can turn into something big such as a new character or a new map in the game.

  <h3>What skills, qualifications, and experience are needed?</h3>
    <p id="rcorners1">Skills a Game Producer II must have are the ability to collaborate and communicate with their team members, as it is crucial for them to work together to deliver content. It is also important that Game Producers have organisational skills, as their position is heavily focused on meeting deadlines and working on a time constraint. Game Producers would also need the skills to observe and have an extensive knowledge about the game industry, as well as being able to keep up to date with what consumers are having issues with or would like to see in the future. They are also expected to have familiarity with working with user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), and having an understanding of how it affects consumers, which also correlates with the skill of being able to understand what consumers want and how they can improve the product for a better experience. <br>
        <br>
    A Game Producer II must have qualifications and experience that show a deep understanding and knowledge of games. In particular, Game Producers require at least three years of experience as a game producer, product manager, or development manager, as well as experience with shipping games or game content in a production role, which means that they have managed to take a game or content to market. Riot Games has also expressed desirable qualifications and experience for their ideal candidate. The company desires someone who has had experience with a live game service, which means that the desired person is familiar with updating games and keeping to deadlines for new developments. Riot Games also desires a person who has experience working with distributed development and outsourcing. This includes working collaboratively towards the outcome of the product, which in this case would be the game ‘Valorant’. It also includes being able to work with third party teams to produce content for the game. The last desired qualification Riot Games seeks for is experience with “game content pipelines” which refers to the process of building a game from stage to stage, from the concept to the completion.

  <h3>What do I possess?</h3>
    <p id="rcorners1">As of currently, I don’t possess any of the required or desired qualifications or experience, however I do believe that the job requires many skills that I do possess to an extent. Basic skills that may be needed for the position can include the ability to be able to collaborate and communicate with team members, which I do have due to playing many team sports, working with co-workers in part time jobs and being a part of the leadership team throughout my schooling experience. I also do believe that I am organised and I am able to stay on task, this can also tie in with an understanding of project management and being able to follow a schedule, as well as being able to meet deadlines. However, other than these basic skills, I don’t possess any of the more technical skills as well as the qualifications and experience that Riot Games seeks. Hence, I aim to make an extensive plan of how I will be able to obtain these required skills, qualifications, and experience to be eligible for my ideal job.

      <h3>How will I obtain the required skills, qualifications, and experience?</h3>
        <p id="rcorners1">The process of working towards this ideal position will be a long one, which I had anticipated due to my lack of experience and qualifications in the game production industry. However, I plan on taking small steps and further building my experience to become the desired candidate Riot Games is looking for. Prior to finding this ideal job, I had also planned on wanting to apply for Riot Games’ university program, which is an internship offered to university students.<br>
          <br>
        Through this internship, I believe that I will be able to gain a wide variety of knowledge about how Riot Games operates and also to be able to meet people who are currently Game Producers, allowing me to gain further insight into the type of position it is and the different types of tasks they perform everyday. I feel like this step would be very beneficial in setting a clear, concrete start to my journey towards this job. With this internship, I also plan on doing further studies in university, branching out to a more specific course that fulfils the qualifications I need for this job. Riot Games never specified a particular course requirement for the job, however I would highly consider further studies in information technology to assist me in becoming a product manager. I could also consider obtaining certificates or diplomas in game development to broaden the choices, assisting me in becoming a game producer.<br>
          <br>
        As I will need to acquire experience as either a game producer, product manager, or development manager, I feel that I could focus on one of these positions and spend a bit of time in that position. Therefore, I will seek jobs at smaller or indie game companies based in Australia that will allow me to gain experience in those required positions. It would be highly ideal if the company that I join in the future, would also help me acquire other desired qualifications. For example, I could choose to apply for jobs at companies that produce live content as well as work with third party teams for game production. I believe that by working at an indie game company, it will allow me to also gain knowledge on how game production works and how I can contribute with my skills and qualifications, which will be built throughout my time there. <br>
          <br>
        I don’t have to work at one company consistently, but it is important that I am able to build my profile and slowly begin to consider working at bigger, well-known companies (Riot Games is a very well known company in the game production industry). I also don’t feel the need to rush into gaining experience, I believe that if the time and circumstances are right, I will eventually become eligible to apply for the position. I think by already establishing to myself that this will be a long journey, it will allow myself to take my time to find the right skills and qualifications, rather than to be heavily focused on applying for this job as soon as possible.
