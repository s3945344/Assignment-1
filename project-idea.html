  <h1>PROJECT IDEA</h1>

      <div class="column">
        <h3>What is your project idea?</h3>
          <p id="rcorners1">‘yours dearly.’ serves a purpose of being made with love for the ones you love. It is a delivery service application which allows for people to buy and send gifts to their loved ones who live overseas, aiming to make it an easier process for them and with the hopes of getting rid of all the extra unnecessary steps that makes something as simple as buying a gift, way too complicated. It is presented as a mobile application which will be available on iOS and Android in any country. As a shopping experience as well, there will be a wide range of gifts and items to consider purchasing, from flowers and plants, to handmade pottery and jewellery - there is such a variety, it will make the gift-giving process more efficient and simpler for consumers who may struggle to choose something, let alone something from a country or city they may not be very familiar with. It also aims to make the shopping experience easier by using a range of different features such as maps, a well-known safe payment method (PayPal), etc.

        <h3>What motivated you to develop this idea?</h3>
        <p id="rcorners1">There is a gap in the market for being able to accommodate those who are in a long distance relationship whether it’s with their partners, family or friends. It has already been shown that applications such as UberEats have shown much success as a delivery app, making it easier for many people to deliver food to their loved ones. However, there is no app or service that offers a more personal and special experience in terms of gift giving, with more long-lasting tangible items that can be kept by loved ones, and allow them to be reminded of the person who got them the gift. Therefore, through ‘yours dearly.’, it will aim to be able to make gifting easier for these people to experience long distance relationships, making it an easier process as well as inclusive so they would be able to pay without any issues or declining due to cards being recognised as registered to banks from overseas. It also makes looking for stores that offer deliveries and aren’t troubled by international payments, a more convenient and simpler process. It is also believed that by having local businesses as gift offerers, it also helps support the community and bring them more business without having to expand overseas. </p>

    <h3>Description of the project idea</h3>
      <img src="yours dearly.png" alt="yours dearly.">
            <p id="rcorners1">The application will be classified as a delivery service application, which will be accessible for anyone, no matter their location in the world. There will be three main users who will use this application - local businesses, customers and people who would like to be delivery people. When the app is used for the first time by a user, they will be asked to specify what kind of user they are and then based on their choice, the app’s sign up page will prompt them to enter their email and some details about them. <br>
              <br>
          For customers, the app will prompt them to provide their email address and details such as their name and their phone number (to alert them if they would like to track their order), and their PayPal account. PayPal has been chosen to be implemented as it ensures customer safety, especially as these customers will be based in a different country. Therefore, it can reassure them that the service can be trusted. When customers enter the app, they will be welcomed with a homepage which will have recommendations or what are currently the hottest gifts to get (the most bought gifts recently). The homepage will also provide a range of categories that the customer can choose from, for example, categories could be flowers and plants, desserts, jewellery, etc. The app for customers will also provide a search bar which will be located in another tab, for customers to enter the address of their loved one. With this information, the app will have a map feature implemented and will provide a map view of the nearest local stores that are registered with the app. However, customers are also able to look further out from the radius of their loved one’s location as well to allow flexibility and more options for them. When a customer clicks on a store, it will lead them to the store’s page where they can view the available products. Like a typical online shopping experience, the customers will be able to put the desired product into their shopping cart and it will then lead them to the check out - this process will be simple as the customers would already have their PayPal account connected to the account, therefore they can go through the checkout process efficiently and without worry. <br>
            <br>
          For local businesses, their sign up page will specifically ask for details such as the stores they want to register, the addresses of these stores and what products they would like to offer on the application. When a business opens an account, they will have freedom to put their products onto the application. They will be asked to provide their opening hours and also details of their packing time, to allow customers to have an idea of when to order a product if they plan on doing so. Registering each product will be a seamless process, where the business can fill in boxes such as the name of the product, the price, a description of the product, if there is a preparation time, they will also be expected to fill it in (it is given as an optional box) as well as an image of the product. For stores to keep updated and track their incoming orders, they are expected to have a device like a tablet to accept the incoming orders. When an incoming order comes during opening hours, the store will receive an audible notification. Then when the store accepts the order, it will alert the customer that their order has been received and is currently being processed. Once the order is ready to be delivered, they can click on the order and there will be a button below that says ‘Send out for delivery’. <br>
            <br>
          For delivery people, this can be done by anyone who has a licence and a vehicle. The proof of a driver’s licence will be required to ensure that they are legally able to drive. The sign up page will also prompt them with what areas they would like to deliver in, as well as if they have preferred hours (this is optional), and their bank details such as their account name and BSB. The app will also require the user to have their location on, in order to show the customer where the location of the driver is currently when their gifts are sent out for delivery. The businesses will have to manually click a button to alert all available drivers in the area, this will show up as a notification and the first person to accept it, will be able to be in charge of the delivery. Another feature for delivery people is that they will be able to build up their profile by gathering reviews from previous customers, using a star rating system. Through a star rating system, it can also help ensure customers that their gifts are being delivered safely to their loved ones.

          <h3>What tools and technology would you need?</h3>
            <img src="python.png" alt="python" height: 500px>
              <p id="rcorners1">There is a wide range of tools and technologies available to assist in the development of the app. It is highly considered to use  programming languages such as Python, C#, HTML 5, etc, to develop the app. However, it would be most likely that Python is chosen as it has familiarity and also provides a large library which will make experimenting with the app more feasible. However, it is also crucial to determine my designs by using wireframes and mockups, to ensure the design and the intended functionality is correct. To create wireframes, there are a large range of different websites that can be used, for example, Balsamiq, to create a wireframe of my application. Using this tool, it opens for various ways to present the app and also see how the ideal pages that are wanted can be linked together smoothly. Once a satisfactory wireframe has been created,websites such as Moqup can be implemented to create a mockup, focusing on the visual elements and what would work best together to enhance the customer experience when using the application. Another tool that could be used would be either Proto.io or Figma to create an interactive prototype of the product. This will allow a proper view of the application and how it would operate if it were to be programmed and final, therefore it will also assist in seeing what changes are needed and figuring out how to improve the interface to ensure customers will be able to have a good experience when they use the application.

            <h3>What skills are required?</h3>
              <p id="rcorners1">Skills that are required include programming language knowledge, which is needed in order to code the app - it is highly ideal to have familiarity with the programming language, which in this case would be Python. Another skill that would be highly beneficial to achieve the development of this app would be the ability to be able to visualise what the application would look like and to be able to present it as a tangible product. This could involve being able to recognise the different interfaces that have been popular with users, referring to apps that are currently doing well in terms of their design. Skills in regards to interface will be utilised effectively when producing wireframes and mockups for the application and it will be effective in regards to making a design that is pleasing and aesthetic for users. In terms of finding required software, it is very easy to access as they are all available on the internet.

            <h3>Outcome of this project idea</h3>
              <p id="rcorners1">If the project is successful, the outcome will be an application that is functional and will be able to be used by anyone as it (hypothetically) would be released as an app that can be downloaded from the App Store (iOS) or the Play Store (Android). The project will be able to fill a gap in the market, with the lack of versatile gift delivery applications. It will also help those who are living a long distance from their loved ones, to be able to have a pleasant experience of being able to buy their loved ones. They will be able to be exposed to a large variety of businesses in their loved one’s community without the stress of being unfamiliar with the area. Not only will customers be able to shop with ease for local goods and specialties, it will also open up opportunities for local businesses and people who are looking for a side job. It allows local businesses to expand internationally, without the need to expand or create a franchise. It will also allow people who are looking for a side job to be able to choose their hours as the app opens for flexibility.
