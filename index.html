			<h2>Get to know me</h2>
			<p id="rcorners1">I was born profoundly deaf, meaning I was born without the ability to hear (which was in both ears). However, I was lucky enough to receive surgery at a very young age, for cochlear implants - as a result, I wear hearing aids and have been for the majority of my life. My parents are from Singapore and Malaysia, but I was born in Australia. Therefore I am only fluent in English, however I did learn Japanese throughout the entirety of high school. I went to Westbourne Grammar School for primary school, before studying at Mount St. Joseph Girlsâ€™ College, where I completed high school. In my spare time, I enjoy playing a wide range of online games with my friends. I love playing first person shooter games, in particular, I am a big fan of the game 'Valorant'.</p>
