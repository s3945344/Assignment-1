			<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
			<p id="rcorners1">Ever since a young age, I have always been interested in technology, and enjoyed being able to learn and pick up new computer skills, so I was encouraged by my parents to consider IT as a potential pathway option. My first proper encounter with IT was in Year 10, when I chose to study IT as one of my electives. Prior to this, I had no idea of what IT actually was and what it offered, as well as what possible pathways it could lead to if I chose to pursue it. However, throughout my time studying this elective, In particular, I had always enjoyed learning the design aspect of IT, such as web development and the programming aspect as well. I always thought the idea of working on something and seeing the final result was very satisfying and I liked that feeling of accomplishment, hence why those aspects of IT always stood out to my liking.</p>

			<h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience.</h3>
			<p id="rcorners1">There was a particular person who sparked my interest, this person was my IT teacher throughout Year 10 to Year 12. She played a significant role in my interest in IT and she was also someone who believed in me when I had a moment of doubt about whether IT was the right career pathway for me. Through her, I learned how to use a wide range of software programs and because she made learning about IT fun, it allowed my passion for the subject to continue to grow. With her, I studied IT in Year 10 and then chose to study Applied Computing: Data Analytics in VCE. In VCE, I learned more about how to work with databases and was introduced briefly to programming, which I grew to really enjoy. </p>

			<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
			<p id="rcorners1"> I was first introduced to RMIT through my brother, who studied Landscape Architecture. Thanks to him, I was able to have a brief overview of the type of university experience RMIT had to offer and I became set on wanting to study at RMIT throughout the entirety of high school - this was regardless of what course I planned on studying as I found the RMIT community very welcoming and exciting. Another reason I chose to come to RMIT was because of the travel time from where I live. RMIT, compared to all the other universities in Melbourne, is the most convenient as my campus is in the city, which means I can take a thirty-to-forty minute train ride without stress.</p>

			<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
			<p id="rcorners1">I believe that IT is quite a broad course to study and it sets the foundation for many different fields of study that I could consider choosing in the future. I expect to learn more about how IT is implemented in everyday life, and how it can be used to build a future of endless possibilities due to the rapid rise in technology. I expect this course to introduce me to many different aspects, such as particular software or design focused aspects. As of now, I donâ€™t have a particular field I want to focus on but I would like to work in the game production industry in the future. Therefore, I want to be able to learn different skills that can allow me to be qualified for different roles in the game production field. I believe that studying IT will definitely help me to determine which career path will suit me best, and also allow me to expand my knowledge and skills. </p>
